-programming methodloly
-6 pillars
1)class
2)objects and methods
3)inheritance
4)polymorphism
5)abtraction
6)encapcilation

access modifiers:
private
public
protected
default



syntax of a class
access modifier class ClassName{}
 compile: javac you.java
 run: java B

symntax of a method:
Writtentype methodName(list of paramenters)
{}

objects:
1) real world entity
2) memory
objects consist of:
1)identity:Name
2)Atrributes/states:AGe.Breed,colour.
3)behaviour:

interfaces are the blue prints of the class. It specify what a class must do and not how.
 
 -It is used to achieve abstraction
 -It supports multiple inheritance
 -It can be jised to achieve loose coupling(not totally dependent) 
 loose coupling is a design goal that seeks to reduce the inter dependencies between the components of a system
 with the goal of reducing the risk that changes in one component will require changes in any other components.
