This is a text file with some palindromes in it.

There are words like "level", "racecar", and "deified"
that are palindromes.

There are also phrases like "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
and "Able was I ere I saw Elba" that are palindromes.

Counting the number of palindromes in a text file can be a fun
and challenging programming problem!
