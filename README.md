The README should contain: 

- A summary the expected behaviour of each function included in your code.
- 
  CODE ONE
  parallel resistors:
  this code calcualtes the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel.
  it finds the inverse of each resistor in a list and adds these inverses.
  It takes into account the that the resistors are actually in parallel ie more than one
  
  CODE TWO
  voltage divider :
  Voltage divideders can be be used to step down in a sense the voltage at certain points in a circuit, they have certain advantages over voltage regulators such as the
  ability to change te resistance easily and hence chance the voltage output inbetween two or more resistors, this code calculates what that voltage between resistors will be
  It accepts the voltage going into the circuit and the resistor values to determine this.

  CODE THREE
  temeperature check
   this code has the ability to check the temperature of and entered temperature to determine if the given temperature is healthy or not, this can be done wether the provided 
   temperature is in celcius or farenhiet provided to user enters this information in the form of a single number an a single character.
  
- The reason the code was written (eg. for the purpose of an assignment, etc).
  To test how much of the material learned in class was properly understood or weeding out certain individuals who use the internet a little too well cause they spent too long trying to get github to work cause one had the same issues online
- A short joke.
  1. my life
  2. my ability to code
  3. today i asked my phone "siri, why am i still single?" and it activated the front camera.
